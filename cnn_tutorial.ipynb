    "Some notes:\n",
    "- All the models had roughly the same number of parameters. In fact, the final linear layer of the MLP and CNN BatchNorm is exactly the same. However, with the CNN, we have a deep feature extractor based on convolution, while with the MLP, we have a single linear layer and ReLU as the feature extractor. In deep learning, we tend to prefer deeper, more complex, and parameter efficient models that are well suited to processing the particular data, rather than a deep models with only fully connected layers.\n",
    "- Both CNNs train faster (lower epoch 1 loss) and converge to a better final loss (lower epoch 5 loss) than the MLP. Both CNNs also have a better test accuracy than the MLP.\n",
    "- CNN BatchNorm performs much better than CNN MaxPool. Indeed, it is a newer architecture that forms the back bone of a lot of modern CNN networks today and empirically has been shown to have better performance on many other tasks than the original CNN formulation.\n",
    "- It would be best to run multiple trials to ensure the statistical validity of these results."
